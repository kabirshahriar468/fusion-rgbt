# RGBT Bird Detection Dataset Configuration
# For YOLO-MIF RGBT Training

# Dataset paths - using relative paths from project root
train: ./dataset/images/visible/train  # path to training images directory
val: ./dataset/images/visible/val      # path to validation images directory

# Number of classes
nc: 2

# Class names (based on your label file showing class 0)
names: ['bird', 'drone']

# Notes:
# - Using relative paths from ultralytics/cfg/datasets/ directory
# - The model will automatically find infrared images by replacing 'visible' with 'infrared' in the path
# - Make sure visible and infrared directories are at the same level
# - Since your IR and RGB images have different naming, you may need to rename them to match
